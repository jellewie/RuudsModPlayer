Hi!

Below I have collected most of the online documentation I am using to create my very own modplayer.
I am doing this with Lazarus-IDE, so with FPC (FreePascal).

Note please that the documentation is very helpfull, but does not cover all the details. I've been
testing/comparing/trying different 'tweaks' to the player going on as much files as is possible.

My initial sound files used are those from Pinball Dreams and Pinball Fantasies. These files run
all OK now (except for missing Arpeggio effect, I'll add that of course..)

Have fun with this stuff!


Interesting internet resources for fileformat / player logic information:
